## Research Methodology

### Assessment Framework
Technologies were evaluated using a three-dimensional scoring system:

**Impact Assessment (40% weighting):**
- 1-3: Incremental improvements to existing processes
- 4-6: Significant advancements enabling new capabilities  
- 7-9: Transformative effects with potential for industry disruption

**Maturity Assessment (40% weighting):**
- 1-3: Early stage/conceptual research
- 4-6: Development/prototyping with lab validation
- 7-9: Mature/deployment ready for commercial scale

**Momentum Assessment (20% weighting):**
- 1-3: Slowing development or declining interest
- 4-6: Stable pace of development and adoption
- 7-9: Accelerating advances and increasing investment

**Composite Score:** (Impact × 0.4) + (Maturity × 0.4) + (Momentum × 0.2)

### Categorization Criteria
- **Deploy:** Impact ≥5, Maturity ≥7
- **Business Pilots:** Impact ≥5, Maturity ≥5, Momentum ≥6  
- **Experiments:** Impact ≥5, Maturity 3-6, Momentum ≥6
- **Monitor:** Impact ≥7, Maturity 1-4, Momentum ≥6

### Research Sources
Primary research sources included authoritative analyst reports and industry publications from:
- Technology Analysts: Gartner, IDC, Forrester
- Management Consulting: McKinsey, BCG, Bain, Accenture
- Industry Research: [Additional sources]
- Academic Publications: [Key institutions]
